```bash
conda create -n xtl-wasm -c conda-forge python=3 cmake openjdk xtl yarn -y

# Get the emsdk repo
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk/

# Download and install the latest SDK tools.
./emsdk install latest

# Make the "latest" SDK "active" for the current user. (writes .emscripten file)
./emsdk activate latest

# source the env file
source ./emsk_env.sh

export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/include

yarn run build:xtl
```

This will generate the WASM and JS files in the `public/dist/` folder.

```bash
yarn run build
```

Then start a local server with:

```bash
yarn run start
```

This will open a new tab in the web browser with the demo app.
